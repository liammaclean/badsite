# Songs of the Fire

## Ballad of the Triangle Fire
### by: Ruth Rubin

Perhaps the most well known song is Ruth Rubin's song from 1968. Rubin is a well known name in folk music as well as Yiddishkeit spaces. The lyrics follow:

    In the heart of New York City, near Washington Square
    In nineteen eleven, March winds were cold and bare.
    A fire broke out in a building ten stories high,
    And a hundred and forty-six young girls in those flames did die.

    On the top floor of that building, ten stories in the air
    These young girls were working in an old sweatshop there;
    They were sewing shirtwaists for a very low wage.
    So tired and pale and worn-out! They were at a tender age.
    
    The sweatshop was a stuffy room with but a single door;
    The windows they were gray with dust from off that dirty floor;
    There were no comforts, no fresh air, no light to sew thereby,
    And the girls, they toiled from early morn till darkness filled the sky.
    
    Then on that fateful day - dear God, most terrible of days!
    When that fire broke out, it grew into a mighty blaze.
    In that firetrap way up there with but a single door,
    So many innocent working girls burned, to live no more!
    
    A hundred thousand mourners, they followed those sad biers.
    The streets were filled with people weeping bitter tears.
    Poets, writers everywhere described that awful pyre,
    When those young girls were trapped to die in the Triangle Fire.
